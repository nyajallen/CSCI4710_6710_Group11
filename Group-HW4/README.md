# CSCI4710_6710_Group11

Our webpage allows a user to find out if one of their classmates is a Vampire! Users have an option to fill out a form asking for information about their classmate and based on a threshold, their answers will determine if their classmate is a vampire. The other option is users can add in their classmate's name and it will randomly decide whether they are a vampire or not. All results are stored in a table and a pie chart so that the user can see how many vampires are in their class.

Below is a flowchart of how our website works!
